        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Kate Wolf (born Kathryn Louise Allen, January 27, 1942 â€“ December 10, 1986) was an American folk singer and songwriter. Though her career was relatively short,
          she had a significant impact on the folk music scene, and many musicians continue to cover her songs. Her best-known compositions include "Here in California,"
          "Love Still Remains," "Across the Great Divide," "Unfinished Life," and "Give Yourself to Love."</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>Born in San Francisco, she started her music career in the band
        Wildwood Flower before recording ten records as a solo artist. Her songs have since been recorded by artists such as Nanci Griffith and Emmylou Harris
        (whose recording of "Love Still Remains" was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1999). An important mentor, friend and touring companion was Utah Phillips.
        She died in 1986, at age 44, after a long battle with leukemia. Her remains are buried at a small church cemetery in Goodyears Bar, California.</p>
